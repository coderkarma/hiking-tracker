# Challenges and Win 
Getting trails based on location was challenging initially, I was trying to figure it out how to implement that and have been making frequent request to that api. I have been blocked when I made 18 api request. I had to put method of payment information to get more api request. I have to grab the location of user with latitude and lagitutude with geocode api from googlemaps. On top of that I had to do another hiking trail api call to grab trails.
